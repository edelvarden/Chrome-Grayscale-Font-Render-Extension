# Font Customizer

_Force the use of custom fonts on web pages._

## Why did I create it?

Some web pages use poor or unreadable fonts. I created this extension because I wanted more control over the fonts I see on the web.

## Why is my solution better than others?

- Respects monospaced fonts.
- Respects iconic fonts (e.g., "Font Awesome", "Material Icons").
- No dependencies.
- Small content script bundle size (~5 kB â”‚ gzip: 2 kB).
- Works very fast.

## How to install?

1. Download the zip file from the releases.
2. Open the `chrome://extensions` page and enable **Developer mode**.
3. Drag & drop the zip file onto the extensions page.

## How to use it?

Click on the extension icon to open the settings. Select a default font from the drop-down list to instantly update the fonts on web pages.

## Features

### Extended Font List

By default, the list displays locally installed fonts and prioritizes using them if they exist. Additionally, it includes popular [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). If a local font is not installed, the extension will fetch it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Advanced Mode

Enable the **Advanced Mode** checkbox to swap between two fonts for easy comparison.

### Ligature Visibility Option

Enable or disable ligatures for monospace fonts (if the font supports them).

### Functionality

The extension parses CSS selectors and variables related to font families from website stylesheets. It replaces them with custom font values and consolidates them into a single style tag injected into the DOM. This approach enhances performance compared to using observers with static selector replacements, especially in dynamic DOM environments where content changes frequently.
