# Font Customizer

_Force the use of custom fonts for web pages._

## Why I created it?

Some web pages use bad or unreadable fonts, I created this extension because I wanted to have more control over the fonts that I see on the web.

## Why is my solution better than others?

- Respects monospaced fonts
- Respects iconic fonts (eg., "Font Awesome", "Material Icons")
- No dependencies
- Small content script bundle size (~ 5 kB â”‚ gzip: 2 kB)
- Works very fast

## How to install?

1. Download zip file from releases
2. Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page and enable **Developer mode**
3. Drag & Drop zip file to extensions page

## How to use it?

Click on the extension icon to open the settings and select a default font from the drop-down list to instantly update it.

## Features

### Extended font list

The list by default displays locally installed fonts, but extended with popular [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). If you don't have a local font installed, the extension fetches it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Advanced mode

Enable **Advanced mode** checkbox to swap between two fonts for comparison.

### Functionality

The extension parses CSS selectors and variables related to font families from website stylesheets. It replaces them with custom font values and consolidates them into a single style tag injected into the DOM. This approach enhances performance compared to using observers with static selector replacements, especially in dynamic DOM environments where content changes frequently.
